	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Flash Potato is a web application that helps make studying
		more efficient and fun. It is beneficial for any student who has a
		problem getting the motivation to study. Students will learn while
		enjoying what they are studying. The intended age group is
		elementary all the way through college because the memorization
		techniques that Flash Potato provides works well at any age.</p>
	<p>This application aims to better prepare its users for exams or
		quizzes. It will motivate them to want to study and do well in their
		courses. The attractiveness of using this app over others is the
		speed and ease of use. The goal is to have a user be able to begin
		creating and using flash cards in as few button clicks as possible.</p>
	<p>Users <b>do not</b> want to have to sign up or register for an
		account on websites, and then have to login in each time to use the
		app. A user should be able to visit a website and not have to create
		an account, and that is what this website accomplishes. Users can
		build a deck of flash cards or begin studying or share with their
		friends or classmates right away.</p>
	<p>Flash Potato was created by Team 31 (Potato):</p>
